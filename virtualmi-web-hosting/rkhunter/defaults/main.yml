# defaults file for rkhunter

# If this option is set to '1', it specifies that the mirrors file
# ('mirrors.dat'), which is used when the '--update' and '--versioncheck'
# options are used, is to be rotated. Rotating the entries in the file allows
# a basic form of load-balancing between the mirror sites whenever the above
# options are used.

# If this option is set to '1', it specifies that when the '--update' option is
# used, then the mirrors file is to be checked for updates as well. If the
# current mirrors file contains any local mirrors, these will be prepended to
# the updated file. If this option is set to '0', the mirrors file can only be
# updated manually. This may be useful if only using local mirrors.

rkhunter_update_mirrors: 1

# The MIRRORS_MODE option tells rkhunter which mirrors are to be used when
# the '--update' or '--versioncheck' command-line options are given.
# Possible values are:
#     0 - use any mirror
#     1 - only use local mirrors
#     2 - only use remote mirrors
